00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
## saying the information requested is pretty 
## standard for an audit so this is correct this  
che dice "l'informazione richiesta è abbastanza
semplice da confermare"


157
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,560
## is what she said no lies there okay that's in line 
## with the message i received so here's paul being  




158
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,680
## extremely aggressive apparently i don't know 
## now requests bank login details to be handled  




159
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,040
## handed over to a non-accountant and a 
## former gang member how is that stuck  




160
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,360
## that's how stock standard audit is carried out is 
## it so that's the aggressive response apparently um  




161
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,040
## this person responds saying you know she's upset 
## because the it's calling joey a former gang member  




162
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,600
## um and saying that screenshots could be 
## manipulated and then paul goes to justify  




163
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,720
## himself saying well joey calls himself 
## an ex-gang member um okay so not not  




164
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,680
## nothing really going on there no [ __ ] off 
## nothing like that so far and it goes on you're  




165
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,520
## thinking okay so where is the [ __ ] off coming 
## where's the [ __ ] off and leave part coming right  




166
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,120
## because that's the main part here that sounds 
## horrible the aggressive [ __ ] off and leave  




167
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,200
## um all we've got here is paul saying get out 
## of here you said get out of here so let's not  




168
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,200
## [ __ ] off and leave and then this person who 
## was an organizer gets out of there she decides  




169
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,920
## to leave and that's it that's it that's the whole 
## interaction yeah can i just pause you there yeah  




170
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,800
## go ahead uh so at this point i didn't even know 
## that she was an organizer that's why she says in  




171
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,320
## the next comment oh no paul bless you i am one of 
## your organizers so she's now informed me of this  




172
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,320
## after you said get out of here yeah so after the 
## uh fact but yeah just wanted to that's it's okay  




173
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,240
## yeah and that that's exactly it's even this is 
## my point basically what i was talking about the  




174
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,760
## whole nickelback thing and how these rumors get 
## spread and it's cool to hate av it's because of  




175
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,280
## things like this don't get me wrong i know 
## there are examples out there of me being an  




176
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,200
## [ __ ] to people and i'm sure there are examples 
## out there of you guys being an [ __ ] to people  




177
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,240
## but to go and actually take something that didn't 
## happen and get it into your head that it happened  




178
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,440
## a certain way where you know you were told to [ 
## __ ] off and leave as an organizer and you know  




179
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,319
## people believe this and and this goes and goes 
## and goes and i guess my question for you is how  




180
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,119
## does this happen how do we get to the point now 
## where we have people that believe that they have  




181
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,919
## been wronged by you they believe it so much that 
## they go and tell other people they were wronged by  




182
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,800
## you that they were told to [ __ ] off when there 
## is literal evidence that you have obviously and  




183
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,560
## it's online to show that this is not how it went 
## why does it happen and why do people believe it  




184
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,400
## instantly without even checking or questioning it 
## like how did we get to this point in your opinion  




185
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:47,760
## it's for the same reason that you get hate when 
## people choose to run hate campaign small or large  




186
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,520
## against you and their baseless claims it's the 
## same reason that anyone of any amount of influence  




187
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:05,760
## in this day and age in this age of outrage you 
## know in this council culture this is the way  




188
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:14,720
## that it works right people don't work off people 
## don't have standards for information anymore then  




189
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,840
## they don't hear something and then screen 
## it they hear something and they say well  




190
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,320
## he said it with conviction or she said it with 
## conviction or they said it with conviction and  




191
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,360
## therefore it must be true and if they said it 
## in the comments section of a post with emotion




192
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,160
## it's true it doesn't you don't need 
## to do any more homework than that so  




193
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,520
## i guess that question is a bit more deeper it's 
## it's it's more of a question about why humans are  




194
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:55,840
## the way humans are yeah yeah and and yeah i can 
## see so you think you you're putting it down to the  




195
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,040
## the more the popularity aspect of it in that like 
## the more the more well-known an individual or a  




196
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,560
## group is the more of this that's going 
## to come is that is that am i right and  




197
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,080
## understanding this is kind of the point yeah 
## and you know a lot of our organizers have had  




198
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:20,800
## challenges in dealing with hate that they get when 
## they come on to become an organizer and represent  




199
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:27,120
## av in their cities because they're seen 
## as like working for hitler you know right  




200
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,600
## and yeah you know we we tell organizers 
## one of the things you learn about being  




201
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:41,600
## a human rights activist when you work 
## with us is dealing with that [ __ ]




202
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,200
## right and that's part of it if you want to do 
## something of influence within this world and make  




203
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:59,200
## an impact i i i agree so um let's yeah i think 
## i think that's a that's going to be a recurring  




204
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,160
## topic to be honest with you so let's let's go 
## on to the like more let's go on to a solid topic
