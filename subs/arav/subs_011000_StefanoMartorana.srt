01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:10,560
## we barely need your name at the cube and uh and 
## that's what we said regarding this whole thing  
chiediamo appena il nome durante il Cubo e
questo è quello che abbiamo detto sulla faccenda.


696
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:18,400
## yeah so if if like putting this into real life 
## like if someone actually did uh come to a cube and  
- Già. Dunque, applichiamo questa cosa alla vita reale,
se qualcuno davvero venisse a un Cubo e,


697
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:25,760
## uh let's say it was it was one of your organizers 
## or you whichever and they said okay i when you  
poniamo che sia uno dei vostri organizzatori o uno
di voi, è lo stesso, e vi dicessero: «Quando


698
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,280
## refer to me as like you know if if they are like 
## doing something and that you're talking about them  
vi riferite a me», ad esempio se sta facendo
qualcosa e state parlando di questa persona,


699
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,560
## like they can't hear you or whatever or maybe 
## they're in the conversation whatever they want  
magari non vi sta sentendo oppure stanno anche
partecipando alla conversazione, non importa, e


700
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,480
## to be referred to as a she um because now they're 
## a trans woman and and is that something that you  
vuole che se ne parli come una lei perché adesso è
una donna trans, è una cosa che rispettereste,


701
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,840
## would respect or you would tell your organizers 
## to respect or would you tell them no only refer to  
direste ai vostri organizzatori di rispettarla
o direste loro di no e di chiamarla solo


702
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:52,560
## them by their name like they're his name but if if 
## by respect you mean are we going to then call them  
per nome? - Se per rispetto intendi
se identificheremo quella persona


703
01:10:53,680 --> 01:11:01,360
## a man in their face in order to make a point that 
## we reject the notion that they identify as a woman  
come un uomo in faccia per dimostrare che
rifiutiamo l'idea che possa identificarsi come una donna,


704
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
## well of course we're not going to do that that 
## that would be impolite and counterproductive for  
ovviamente non abbiamo intenzione di farlo, sarebbe
da maleducati e controproducente per la


705
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,000
## our mission on the streets to begin with which is 
## to get on with non-human animal rights activism  
nostra missione in strada tanto per cominciare, la missione
consiste nell'unirsi all'attivismo per i diritti degli


706
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:22,320
## not get caught up in issues between humans human 
## centric issues and the reason why i'm pointing out  
animali non umani, non di invischiarsi in problemi
antropocentrici


707
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,840
## that i initially started with pointing out that  




708
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:33,600
## this is clearly ideological is that we don't 
## allow any other political ideologies to be  




709
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,840
## carried out or political agendas to be carried 
## out at the cubes of any kind so when we've never  




710
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:46,160
## specifically targeted this in any way you 
## know it's just across the board not welcome  




711
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,160
## sure and what what what about in the case that 
## someone doesn't actually believe or doesn't really  




712
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:57,200
## agree with you that it's political because a lot 
## of people who are become become a trans woman or a  




713
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,920
## trans man they don't do it out of some political 
## ideology they do it because they have gender  




714
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:08,160
## dysphoria right it's a medical condition and them 
## being referred to as a he or she um it's nothing  




715
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,880
## to do with their politics is to do with them being 
## like validated as a person right so it's actually  




716
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,960
## really important i know i know there are a lot 
## of trans activists out there who are making this  




717
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,600
## very very political i understand that they exist 
## and there are people who are not even trans who  




718
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,320
## make it political by forcing others to call them 
## a he or she when they've they don't have gender  




719
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,480
## dysphoria you know what i mean i understand 
## this is happening and i understand standing  




720
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,920
## up to that but in the case where these people 
## are genuine um and you know they are asking as a  




721
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:42,400
## as like a you know as a courtesy to help them 
## adapt to this new life for example uh would that  




722
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:47,680
## be a policy of av to to tell people right you 
## refer to them as they want to be referred to or  




723
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,320
## is that not a policy navy and it's no you 
## just you call them by name and that's it




724
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:01,200
## so just to clarify here because i think there's 
## some things being communicated that in this  




725
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,680
## interaction that might lead people to think that 
## we've commented on trans people when we haven't  




726
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:13,360
## even commented on trans people at all ever ever 
## uh my comments were only about gender pronouns  




727
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:21,360
## and uh gender pronouns are a completely different 
## discussion to trans issues gender pronouns  




728
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:28,160
## are used by people who don't even identify as 
## trans so i'm not talking about trans people i've  




729
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:32,880
## never talked i've never said anything about trans 
## people and neither is a cell and that needs to be  




730
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:39,200
## clarified 100 i think because i don't appreciate 
## getting tossed into that category of someone who  




731
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,560
## has spoken about trans people when i haven't said 
## a single word about trans people uh my comments  




732
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:50,400
## are about my skepticism towards gender pronouns 
## and the use of gender pronouns and then being  




733
01:13:50,400 --> 01:14:00,800
## 50 plus gender pronouns that was my comment and uh 
## this like i said at the cube there's no real need  




734
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:08,960
## for even even for someone's name so if if this is 
## happening this interaction is happening at a cube  




735
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,840
## where someone is offended because you 
## haven't used their correct gender pronoun  




736
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,720
## that's what i mean by becoming political 
## and someone bringing a political agenda into  




737
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:25,600
## that space when we don't even really require 
## your name so if that discussion is occurring  




738
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:31,360
## at the cube it's likely because someone is 
## choosing to make a rise out of it and you know to  




739
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:40,720
## uh to you know obviously if someone is like i 
## said already going out of their way to disrespect  




740
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:45,440
## somebody like this yes we would take issue 
## with that 100 we would see that as bullying  




741
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:51,600
## it would be implied and it would be bullying 
## to say no i don't not only do i not believe  




742
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:58,560
## what you believe but your belief is stupid that's 
## bullying right so of course we don't condone that
